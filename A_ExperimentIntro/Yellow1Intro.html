<p>Here is a brief overview of the study.</p>

    <b><u> What will I have to do?</u></b>   <br />
This study will consist of two tasks along with brief survey questions, and should take an average of 30 minutes
    to complete in total.
    <br /><br />

    <b> <u>How much payment will I receive for my participation?</u></b>
  <br>You will receive {{ session.config.participation_fee }} as the participation fee for completing the study.<br>
    <br>You will also have the opportunity to earn additional money.<br>
    <br>In this study, we will be using a currency called “tokens”. These tokens will determine your <b>additional
    earnings</b>, which will depend on your performance and the decisions you make. For each token you earn, you
    will be paid £0.05.  As an example, if you earned 100 tokens in total, you would be paid £5 (100*£0.05).<br>
    <br>Your total payment from this study will be equal to the participation fee plus your additional earnings.
    So, if you earned 100 tokens in total for the two tasks, you would be paid a total of £8.75 (£3.75 + £5).<br>
