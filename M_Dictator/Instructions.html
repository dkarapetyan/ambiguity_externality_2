<p>Thank you for completing the Encryption task. Recall that in that task, you were matched with a Blue player whose
    payoff scheme decreased your earnings. We now turn to the Decision task.</p>
<p>In this task, <b>you (as the Yellow player)</b> are matched with the <b>same Blue player</b> you were matched with
    for the Encryption task. You will now be given <b>20 tokens</b>,
    while your matched Blue player will be given <b>10 tokens</b>. However, you now have an opportunity to change
    their earnings.
<p>You can transfer tokens to, or take away tokens from, your matched Blue player. You can transfer a <b>positive amount</b> in 1 token increments <b>up to a total
    of 20 tokens</b>, or you can take away/transfer a <b>negative amount</b> in 1 token increments <b>up to a total
    of 10 tokens</b>. Positive and negative transfer examples are provided on the next screen.</p>
