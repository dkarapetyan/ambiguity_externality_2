  <b>Overview of Study </b>
  <br />
    Here is a brief overview of the study.
    <br />
 <br />
    <b><u> What will I have to do?</u></b>   <br />
This study will be divided into <b>two parts</b>. Each part consists of two main tasks along with brief survey questions.
    <br /><br />
    You will now participate in Part I. After you have made your decisions in Part I, the computer program will prompt you to start Part 2 of the study.
    <br /><br />
    Parts 1 and 2 together should take an average of <b>30 minutes</b> to complete in total.
    <br /><br />
    <b> <u>How much payment will I receive for my participation?</u></b>
  <br>You will receive {{ session.config.participation_fee }} for completing  <b>both</b> Part 1 and Part 2 of the study.<br>

  <br>You may receive <b>additional bonus payments</b> depending on the decisions you make, and the decisions other individuals make who are paired with you in either Part 1 or Part 2. At the end of the study, the computer program will <b>randomly pick either Part I or Part 2</b> to determine your bonus payment.  Since nobody knows which part will be selected for payment, you should pay close attention to both parts as your decisions may determine your earnings.<br>

    <br><b><u>How will payment be made?</u></b>
  <br>Once all participants complete this study, we will determine bonus payments based on the decisions you and your paired counterpart made in the tasks in either Part I or Part 2. The bonus payment will be made via the Prolific platform within a maximum of 21 days from the conclusion of the study.<br>

  <br>You will receive the completion payment of {{ session.config.participation_fee }} and your bonus payment <b>only if you complete both Part 1 and Part 2</b> of the study. <br>

    <br><b><u>Please note!</u></b>
  <br>There will be several <b>Attention Check</b> questions throughout this study meant to test whether you are paying attention.  <b>If you fail to correctly complete one or more of these Attention Check questions, you may not be paid.</b><br>

  <br>Finally, please note that this research <b>does not employ deception</b>. This is regulated by the researchers’ institutional ethics committees.
