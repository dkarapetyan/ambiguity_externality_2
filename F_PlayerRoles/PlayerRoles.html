    <p>
        In this study, individuals participate in pairs. This means that you will be paired with another
        individual participating in the study, and that your decisions may impact their earnings, while their
        decisions may impact your earnings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participants have different roles, and to differentiate between them, we have labeled them as the "Blue player"
        and the "Yellow player".

    <ul>
        <li>You have been assigned to be the <b>Blue player</b>.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Your counterpart Yellow player will be randomly matched with you for each part of the study. Once you
            complete Part 1, you will be re-matched with <b>another</b>
            Yellow player for Part 2. And, once you complete Part 2, you will again be re-matched with another
            Yellow player for Part 3.</li>

        <li>Your counterpart Blue player has been randomly selected. Note that the Blue player has already participated
            in the study, but the decisions that you make can still affect their final payment. How the payments
            are affected will be explained on the next screen.</li>
